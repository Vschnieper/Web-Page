<blockquote>
<p>Porto. Rain, cold. November 26th, 2019. An early morning dense fog takes time to dissipate due to the low temperature and high humidity of the environment. The water keeps falling from the sky. The ground is flooding. It gets muddy. It changes. <strong>Puddles</strong> have taken over the landscape.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The random <strong>landscape of wetlands</strong> that emerges due to the high probability of <strong>precipitation</strong> in Porto is at least one of the most interesting <strong>spatial situations</strong> that Parque da Cidade has. But, what if the <strong>topography</strong> could be <strong>modified</strong> in such a way that the puddles always appear in the <strong>same place</strong>? What if, at the same time, <strong>rainwater runoff</strong> could be controlled so that it always falls where it <strong>interests</strong> us?</p>
<p>More than <strong>50,000</strong> square meters of thin and transparent <strong>textile cover</strong>. Great differences in elevation on an <strong>irregular</strong> topography full of water and vegetation will give rise to unique <strong>temperature</strong> differences and <strong>air flows</strong> depending on where we are and, as a consequence, to a series of natural <strong>microclimates</strong> throughout the area.</p>
<p>As if it were an <strong>extension of the Atlantic</strong>, great <strong>splashes of the waves</strong> towards the interior of the urban layout. <em>Inundaci√≥n Intermitente</em> becomes a complete landscape reconditioning and a new way of living the Parque da Cidade.</p>

                                    <p><em>(Project in <strong>collaboration</strong> with Clara Calvo and Alfonso Rubio)</em></p>
<p>The <strong>Auditorium</strong> in Parque Juan Carlos I in Madrid was closed in 2008 and has remained <strong>abandoned</strong> ever since. Eleven years later, the <strong>water</strong> is not flowing. The <strong>lights</strong> no longer dance. The <strong>music</strong> stopped playing long ago. There is no more <strong>performance</strong>. Everything has <strong>changed</strong>.</p>
<p>With this project, the building is proposed to be <strong>rehabilitated</strong> by means of a new folded and retractable <strong>textile</strong> cover, like the one in the Plaza de Toros de Zaragoza. Cables, rings, masts and more than 130 metres of textile membrane are intended to refurbish the place for future <strong>open-air</strong> shows.</p>

                                    <p>The small city of Godoy Cruz belongs to the province of Mendoza (Argentina). It is characterized by its <strong>low altitude</strong>, in <strong>contrast</strong> with the great <strong>mountain range</strong> of the Andes and its enormous peak, the Aconcagua, next to which it is located.</p>
<p>A <strong>residential</strong> project is proposed as an <strong>analogy</strong> to the mountain and river landscape, which is why this area stands out so much. A great <strong>cross</strong> is designed in which the <strong>houses</strong> at different heights will simulate the <strong>mountain range</strong>, and a <strong>linear fluvial park</strong> will join the lower public pedestrian areas simulating the <strong>rivers</strong> of Argentina.</p>

                                    <p>In contrast to the <strong>traditional</strong> architecture of Nagele, the <strong>orthogonality</strong> of its streets and buildings and the great grass <strong>plains</strong> of Holland, <em>Creating Contrasts</em> aims to <strong>break</strong> these rules completely.</p>
<p>By creating <strong>slopes</strong> next to the village, which will be named &ldquo;petals&rdquo;, a series of <strong>vegetation covers</strong> will be formed under which a new <strong>residential</strong> project will appear.</p>
<p>The <strong>compositional</strong>, <strong>constructive</strong> and <strong>structural</strong> design of these large coverings, as well as of the house itself, will be based on a <strong>hierarchical</strong> development in which the king will be the <strong>vertical</strong> structure.</p>

                                    <p>The objective of the project is the creation of a <strong>thermal bath building</strong>, or <em>hotspot</em>, in Reykjavik, Iceland. It will take into account both the problematic <strong>climate</strong> of this location, and the lack of <strong>light</strong> due to the short duration of the days, as well as the contrast in <strong>temperature</strong> between inside and outside.</p>
<p>To this end, it was decided to operate in the shape of a <strong>tower</strong>, dividing the project in two parts: a great square <strong>base</strong> that will house the uses of reception, changing rooms and cafeteria, all wrapped in an opaque <strong>GRC</strong> skin; and a series of <strong>out-of-phase platforms</strong> that will contain the pools, these in turn, wrapped in a <strong>glass</strong> skin that will allow light to enter from any point.</p>
