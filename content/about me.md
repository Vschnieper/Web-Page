## VÃ­ctor de la Plaza Schnieper

I am a young architect, graphic designer and 3D artist living in Madrid. I love photography, artistic drawing and travelling. I consider myself a geek of development of new technologies and computers.  I am a fast learner, a very curious and self-taught person who loves to gain experience every day.
