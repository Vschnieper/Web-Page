# Hello!

My name is **VÃ­ctor de la Plaza Schnieper**. 

I am a young **architect**, graphic **designer** and **3D artist** living in Madrid. I love **photography**, artistic **drawing** and **travelling**. I consider myself a geek of development of new **technologies and computers**.  I am a fast learner, a very curious and self-taught person who loves to gain **experience** every day.

I am an elite **Wushu (Kung-Fu)** athlete and a member of the **Spanish national team**. I also train in the **High Performance Centre** in Madrid. I have been practicing this sport since I was a **child** and it is now part of my life.
