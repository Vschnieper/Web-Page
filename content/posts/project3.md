        <p>The small city of Godoy Cruz belongs to the province of Mendoza (Argentina). It is characterized by its <strong>low altitude</strong>, in <strong>contrast</strong> with the great <strong>mountain range</strong> of the Andes and its enormous peak, the Aconcagua, next to which it is located.</p>
        <p>A <strong>residential</strong> project is proposed as an <strong>analogy</strong> to the mountain and river landscape, which is why this area stands out so much. A great <strong>cross</strong> is designed in which the <strong>houses</strong> at different heights will simulate the <strong>mountain range</strong>, and a <strong>linear fluvial park</strong> will join the lower public pedestrian areas simulating the <strong>rivers</strong> of Argentina.</p>
