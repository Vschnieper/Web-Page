        <p>In contrast to the <strong>traditional</strong> architecture of Nagele, the <strong>orthogonality</strong> of its streets and buildings and the great grass <strong>plains</strong> of Holland, <em>Creating Contrasts</em> aims to <strong>break</strong> these rules completely.</p>
        <p>By creating <strong>slopes</strong> next to the village, which will be named &quot;petals&quot;, a series of <strong>vegetation covers</strong> will be formed under which a new <strong>residential</strong> project will appear.</p>
        <p>The <strong>compositional</strong>, <strong>constructive</strong> and <strong>structural</strong> design of these large coverings, as well as of the house itself, will be based on a <strong>hierarchical</strong> development in which the king will be the <strong>vertical</strong> structure.</p>
