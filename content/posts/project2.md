In contrast to the traditional architecture of Nagele, the orthogonality of its streets and buildings and the great grass plains of Holland, Creating Contrasts aims to break these rules completely.

By creating slopes next to the village called "petals", a series of vegetation covers will be formed under which a new residential project will appear. 

The compositional, constructive and structural design of these large coverings, as well as of the house itself, will be based on a hierarchical development in which the king will be the vertical structure.
