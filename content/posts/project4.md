The Auditorium in Parque Juan Carlos I in Madrid was closed in 2008 and has remained abandoned ever since. Eleven years later, the water is not flowing. The lights no longer dance. The music stopped playing long ago. There is no more performance. Everything has changed.

With this project, it is proposed to rehabilitate the building by means of a new folded and retractable textile cover, like the cover of the Bullring of Zaragoza. Cables, rings, masts and more than 130 metres of textile membrane are intended to refurbish the place for future open-air shows.
