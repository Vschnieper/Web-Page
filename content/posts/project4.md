        <p><em>(Project in <strong>collaboration</strong> with Clara Calvo and Alfonso Rubio)</em></p>
        <p>The <strong>Auditorium</strong> in Parque Juan Carlos I in Madrid was closed in 2008 and has remained <strong>abandoned</strong> ever since. Eleven years later, the <strong>water</strong> is not flowing. The <strong>lights</strong> no longer dance. The <strong>music</strong> stopped playing long ago. There is no more <strong>performance</strong>. Everything has <strong>changed</strong>.</p>
        <p>With this project, the building is proposed to be <strong>rehabilitated</strong> by means of a new folded and retractable <strong>textile</strong> cover, like the one in the Plaza de Toros de Zaragoza. Cables, rings, masts and more than 130 metres of textile membrane are intended to refurbish the place for future <strong>open-air</strong> shows.</p>
