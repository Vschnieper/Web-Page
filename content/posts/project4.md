*(Project in **collaboration** with Clara Calvo and Alfonso Rubio)*

The **Auditorium** in Parque Juan Carlos I in Madrid was closed in 2008 and has remained **abandoned** ever since. Eleven years later, the **water** is not flowing. The **lights** no longer dance. The **music** stopped playing long ago. There is no more **performance**. Everything has **changed**.

With this project, the building is proposed to be **rehabilitated** by means of a new folded and retractable **textile** cover, like the one in the Plaza de Toros de Zaragoza. Cables, rings, masts and more than 130 metres of textile membrane are intended to refurbish the place for future **open-air** shows.
