        <blockquote>
        <p>Porto. Rain, cold. November 26th, 2019. An early morning dense fog takes time to dissipate due to the low temperature and high humidity of the environment. The water keeps falling from the sky. The ground is flooding. It gets muddy. It changes. <strong>Puddles</strong> have taken over the landscape.</p>
        </blockquote>
        <p>The random <strong>landscape of wetlands</strong> that emerges due to the high probability of <strong>precipitation</strong> in Porto is at least one of the most interesting <strong>spatial situations</strong> that Parque da Cidade has. But, what if the <strong>topography</strong> could be <strong>modified</strong> in such a way that the puddles always appear in the <strong>same place</strong>? What if, at the same time, <strong>rainwater runoff</strong> could be controlled so that it always falls where it <strong>interests</strong> us?</p>
        <p>More than <strong>50,000</strong> square meters of thin and transparent <strong>textile cover</strong>. Great differences in elevation on an <strong>irregular</strong> topography full of water and vegetation will give rise to unique <strong>temperature</strong> differences and <strong>air flows</strong> depending on where we are and, as a consequence, to a series of natural <strong>microclimates</strong> throughout the area.</p>
        <p>As if it were an <strong>extension of the Atlantic</strong>, great <strong>splashes of the waves</strong> towards the interior of the urban layout. <em>Inundaci√≥n Intermitente</em> becomes a complete landscape reconditioning and a new way of living the Parque da Cidade.</p>
