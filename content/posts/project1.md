The objective of the project is the creation of a **thermal bath building**, or *hotspot*, in Reykjavik, Iceland. It will take into account both the problematic **climate** of this location, and the lack of **light** due to the short duration of the days, as well as the contrast in **temperature** between inside and outside.
 
To this end, it was decided to operate in the shape of a **tower**, dividing the project in two parts: a great square **base** that will house the uses of reception, changing rooms and cafeteria, all wrapped in an opaque **GRC** skin; and a series of **out-of-phase platforms** that will contain the pools, these in turn, wrapped in a **glass** skin that will allow light to enter from any point.
