        <p>The objective of the project is the creation of a <b>thermal bath building</b>, or <b>hotspot</b>, in Reykjavik, Iceland. It will take into account both the problematic <b>climate</b> of this location, and the lack of <b>light</b> due to the short duration of the days, as well as the contrast in <b>temperature</b> between inside and outside.</p>
        <p>To this end, it was decided to operate in the shape of a <b>tower</b>, dividing the project in two parts: a great square <b>base</b> that will house the uses of reception, changing rooms and cafeteria, all wrapped in an opaque <b>GRC</b> skin; and a series of <b>out-of-phase platforms</b> that will contain the pools, these in turn, wrapped in a <b>glass</b> skin that will allow light to enter from any point.</p>
