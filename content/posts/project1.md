The objective of the project is the creation of a thermal bath building, or Hotspot, in Reykjavik, Iceland. It will take into account both the problematic climate of this place, and the lack of light due to the short duration of the days, as well as the contrast in temperature between the interior and exterior.
 
To this end it was decided to operate in the shape of a tower, dividing the project into two: a great square base that will house the uses of reception, changing rooms and cafeteria, all wrapped in an opaque GRC skin; and a series of platforms out of phase with each other that will contain the pools, these in turn wrapped in a glass skin that will allow light to enter from any point.
